  "summary": "I will modify `Sessions.tsx` and `Dashboard.tsx` to include dummy data. This ensures that when the application is run for a demo, it displays populated data even if the backend is not available or empty. I will implement a fallback mechanism where the application attempts to fetch data from the API, and if that fails, it defaults to the dummy data.",
